"""Pipeline: one full run of JobSpy Lite.

Sequence (each run, cron or manual):
  1. Scrape every configured search term/site (config + settings overrides).
  2. Upsert raw jobs so nothing is lost, and detect which are new.
  3. Score only what needs scoring:
     - new jobs, or rows with no score yet, or rows whose stored resume hash
       predates the current resume (resume changed since scoring), or rows
       last scored more than RESCORE_AFTER_HOURS ago, or ``force_rescore``.
  4. Persist annotations (required years, experience match, score, skills);
     user status/notified are preserved by storage.upsert_job.
  5. Export the jobs table to Excel and send Telegram alerts for
     above-threshold matches.
  6. Record everything on a ``runs`` row.
